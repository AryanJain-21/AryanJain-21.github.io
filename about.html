            <p>In this section, I will delve deeper into my interests and projects. I enjoy exploring data analytics and supply chain optimization techniques. Here are some projects I've finished:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Netflix Interactive Dashboard</strong> <br>
                    <em>October 2024</em> <br>
                    Implemented functions to filter and parse through the Netflix catalog for effective media selection. Integrated a MongoDB database within Docker alongside an API and frontend using Python libraries such as PyMongo and Holoviz to create an interactive dashboard for analyzing the Netflix catalog. Conducted advanced data analysis, cleaning, and preparation of raw data for the Holoviz Panel dashboard queried by API.

                    <strong>League Database Manager</strong> <br>
                    <em>April 2024</em> <br>
                    Developed personas and relational diagrams to facilitate the creation of a database in SQL for managing data related to players, coaches, and more in a league. Built a Docker-based full-stack connection with a REST API and Appsmith frontend linked to the database. Utilized GitHub and Git Project Management skills to manage and develop the project collaboratively.

                    Analyzed extensive hospitalization and AQI datasets to document the correlation between Covid hospitalizations and AQI, supported by data visualizations and supplementary research. Implemented complex machine-learning algorithms using Python libraries such as sklearn to derive insights from the data. Presented findings and model creation to project managers, showcasing critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.
