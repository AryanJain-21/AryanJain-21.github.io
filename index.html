            <p>Hello! My name is Aryan Jain, and I am starting the next chapter of my life as a Data Science and Supply Chain Management major at Northeastern University. Currently, I am looking for a summer internship and July-December Co-Op opportunities after completing my second year at Northeastern's Boston campus. After my undergraduate studies, I hope to pursue a career in data or supply chain management in the pharma industry and eventually pursue my technical passions.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>A topic that has always captivated me is solving logical problems. From a young age, I was drawn to games that challenged my critical and strategic thinking, such as Sudoku and other puzzle-based video games. The thrill of unraveling complex problems stuck with me, and this passion led me to pursue a data science major in college. I realized that logical thinking was not just a hobby; it was the foundation for tackling real-world problems through data-driven analysis.</p>
                    <p>One of the areas where I have channeled this passion is healthcare. In my recent research work, I have applied data-driven research to improve efficiency in healthcare. The way data can be used to identify trends, optimize processes, and develop solutions feels like an extension of the logical problems I find myself captivated in. The intellectual stimulation and real-world applications of the work keep me fully engaged and constantly learning.</p>
                    <p>Sharing this excitement with others has been a natural extension of my passion. Whether with friends or family, I find myself discussing the intricacies of data problems and encouraging others to explore the field, acting as their bridge into unknown territory. Some afterwards even delve into the discipline themselves. It has been incredibly rewarding to see others develop their own interest in logical reasoning after hearing me discuss these topics.</p>
                    <p>For me, data science and logical reasoning are more than simple disciplines; they are ways to explore and solve all kinds of puzzles in the world. The ability to apply my passion to impactful real-world problems, and to share that passion with others, is a part of what makes this topic so engaging. I lose track of time because every problem I encounter presents an opportunity to make a meaningful difference, whether in healthcare, technology, or beyond.</p>
